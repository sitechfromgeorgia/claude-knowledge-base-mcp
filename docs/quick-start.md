## 🧠 Understanding Marathon Intelligence

### Smart MCP Discovery

Marathon automatically discovers your installed MCPs and creates optimization strategies:

```
🔍 Discovered MCPs:
✅ Core Systems: claude-knowledge-base, memory, sequential-thinking
✅ Server Management: acura-server, econom-server  
✅ Development Tools: github, filesystem, desktop-commander
✅ Business Tools: erpnext, n8n-integrations

🎯 Optimization Strategies:
- Server tasks: acura-server + desktop-commander
- Development: github + filesystem + desktop-commander  
- AI enhancement: context7-ai + sequential-thinking
```

### Context Transfer Magic

When your context approaches limits (80,000 tokens), Marathon automatically:

```
🏃‍♂️ CONTEXT TRANSFER PREPARATION
📊 Context: 78,432 tokens (98% of limit)
🔄 Generating seamless transfer...

📋 TRANSFER READY - Copy to new chat:
"Continue Marathon session: [PRESERVED_STATE]
Progress: Database setup complete, starting monitoring
MCPs: acura-server✓ github✓ desktop-commander✓"
```
